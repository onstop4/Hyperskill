# Projects for JetBrains Academy
These are several projects I completed a while ago for [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/).

## Smart Calculator
This project aimed to create a functioning calculator for simple expressions. It converts each expression from infix notation to postfix notation and then solves the result.

It can be found in the `calculator` package. More details can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/42).

## Encryption-Decryption
This project aimed to create a program that encrypts and decrypts text, either by shifting all the characters or only shifting the letters.

It can be found in the `encryptdecrypt` package. More details can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/46).

## Phone Book
This project aimed to create a program that stores and retrieves phone numbers associated with various people. The program first reads in a list of phone numbers and names. Then it reads a list of names and determines how many of those names were found in the original file. It does this through various sorting and searching algorithms.

It can be found in the `phonebook` package. More details can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/63).

## Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder
This project aimed to create a program that can recognize and correct errors in strings. It accomplished this by taking a user's input, tripling each character, modifying several of the characters (to simulate errors in transmission), and then correcting those errors. Once corrected, the original string would be outputted.

I only finished stage 2 of the project. It can be found in the `corrector` package. More details can be found [here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/58).
